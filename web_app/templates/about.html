    <section class="about">
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>CleanSlate was inspired by a need for greater control over our social media data. With so many platforms storing personal posts and messages, we realized there was no easy way to manage and delete this data across different platforms. Our journey started as a project to solve this issue.</p>
        <p>We wanted to create a user-friendly, open-source tool that empowers users to manage their social presence on their terms. This is more than just a toolâ€”it's a way to help people take control of their digital lives. It all began as a Portfolio Project for <a href="https://www.holbertonschool.com" target="_blank">Holberton School</a>, and has since grown into something bigger.</p>
        <p>We're proud to offer CleanSlate as a powerful solution for anyone looking to simplify their online presence.</p>
